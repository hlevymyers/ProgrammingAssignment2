## the first function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
## the second function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by
## the first function.  If the inverse has already been calculated then it will
## retreive the cached inverse.

## The first function that creates a matrix object

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()){
  m <- matrix(c(-4, 0, 8, 3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
}
  m
  
is.matrix(m)


## This second function computes the inverse of the first matrix. If the inverse 
## has already been calculated then the cacheSolve will retrieve the inverse from 
## cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, makeCacheMatrix) 
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        matrixsol <- solve(m)
        print("Solving matrix. Here is the solution:")
        matrixsol
